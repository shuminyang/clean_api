# Graphql_TypeDI

Trying out graphql with typeDI and integration with mikroORM.

1. Make sure you have postgreSQL installed
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run start` -> be careful, this doesn't use ts-node, so `watch` has to run first in order to generate compiled js files.
4. GraphQL Playground should be up and running on `localhost:4000`
